          <h4>Development & Design</h4>
          <p>
            I am a Full-stack web developer. However, I seem to have an eye for
            design thus more inclined towards the front-end part of the web. I
            find it enjoyable working on projects involving user experience. As
            for the back-end architecture, I have worked with Database
            Management Systems specifically MySQL working with PHP, Mongo DB
            with node js and Express.

          <h4>Time in development</h4>
          <p>
            I believe in shipping quality code. Therefore, I put much effort on
            improving my coding skills; working round the clock on side
            projects, implementing best coding practices sourced from relevant
            books and online resources, as well as learning new technology
            stack. I am an expert who knows the value of time, hardwork and
            honesty in relation to delivering quality work without delays.

        <div class="job job-3">
          <h4>Learning and Training</h4>
          <p>
            I pursued Forensic Science in Kenyatta University for my
            undergraduate studies. Back then, doing class projects in C++, made
            my interest for coding level up. I decided to enroll for coding
            classes while at the same time using available online resources and
            books to work with more programming languages, frameworks, APIs
            among other useful tools for building websites and applications.
